INLINING OPTION VALUES:
  -inline-factor: 100
  -inline-min-size: 30
  -inline-max-size: 230
  -inline-max-total-size: 2000
  -inline-max-per-routine: 10000
  -inline-max-per-compile: 500000

In the inlining report below:
   "sz" refers to the "size" of the routine. The smaller a routine's size,
      the more likely it is to be inlined.
   "isz" refers to the "inlined size" of the routine. This is the amount
      the calling routine will grow if the called routine is inlined into it.
      The compiler generally limits the amount a routine can grow by having
      routines inlined into it.

INLINING FOOTNOTES:

<1> The subprogram is larger than the inliner would normally inline.  Use the
    option -inline-max-size to increase the size of any subprogram that would
    normally be inlined, add "!DIR$ATTRIBUTES FORCEINLINE" to the
    declaration of the called function, or add "!DIR$ FORCEINLINE" before
    the call site.
